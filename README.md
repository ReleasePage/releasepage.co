## What is ReleasePage?

ReleasePage allows you to create a client-facing changelog for your app.

Powered by GitHub tags and releases, you can keep the technical details alongside your source code as nature intended, while also providing a beautiful place for your users to stay up-to-date with any changes.

#### Always up to date

As you tag and create releases on GitHub, your Release Page will stay up to date, meaning your users will always be able to find the latest information about your software.

#### Combine projects

Have several repositories that make up your overall product? Your Release Page can **combine** your notes for each project into one release.

#### Subscribers

By allowing users to **subscribe** to your Release Page, you can make sure they are always aware of your latest releases.

#### Custom theming

Extensive theming and customisation possibilities allow you to adapt your Release Page to your project brand.

You can even use your own domain!
